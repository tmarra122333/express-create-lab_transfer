### EXPRESS CREATE: ADD VIEW LAYER TO PRODUCTS APP

* This repo includes starter code, so be sure to **clone** this repo.  You **do not need to fork it**.  (Why?  See if you can figure out why.)

* `npm install` to install dependencies. While you're watching the modules download think to yourself: **What is the importance of this part of the process? Why am I doing this?**



### What Is It?

This is a simple app that sends JSON to the browser.

The JSON is an array of 'products' inside products.js

The routes for **index**, **show**, and **create** have been made.

You need to convert this app into one that has views.


### Directions 

**Make it so the app shows the user a form that allows them to create new products**

#### Leading questions

* Do you need to install `ejs`? 



* Do you need to make a `views` folder? 



* Is there a folder you should put inside the views folder?  Is it possible that this question doesn't have only one correct answer? 



* Will you need a route to serve up the form?



* In what file would you put the form?

* Is there a view that the POST route renders? Or should it just continue to redirect?



#### When you have the form working and creating data:

* What other views would we need to make this app complete? See if you can put them in!

* Add links to the pages that allow the user to navigate around the pages by clicking like an actual web site.


#### Remember

A **`Product`** has the following properties:

* `name`
* `price`
* `img`


### Hungry for more

* Refactor the application to where products.js is inside a models folder. (For the M in MVC).

* Research and leverage ejs features like includes and partials for the header of the site. 

* Start over with another resource (i.e. cat, cards, etc) and build all the routes and views for it.
